# dvgtutorial
Real Python Django, Vue and GraphQL tutorial. All code credited to Real Python and tutorial author Dane Hillard. 

Purpose

Try making a simple Django REST API, Vue front end and use GraphQL to tie it together.

Observations

1. I'm liking Python more as I use it more
2. I was only using raw JavaScript for my university courses. It was painful. JQuery, Vue and others make it so much less painful.
3. I would still rather do all my web work in Not JavaScript XD
4. I love the decoupling that comes from setting up the website the way it is done in this tutorial. Really love it. I like modules, I like being able to separate my code in chunks I can easily grok, I like the comfort of doing if I do something insane in a module I can just turn it off and rework it while everything else still works. So this particular app architecture makes me happy.
5. Using Django for the back end entirely separate from the front end makes me curious about using Python for backing something like a Unity game or something.
6. I like tutorials for things I am completely new to. I am not sure I would do much of a tutorial for another web framework. I am starting to see enough commonalities that I would probably read a tutorial quickly, dive into the docs and try to stand up something simple. There is a time cost to tutorials.
7. One good thing about some of the tutorials I have done is they point out a whole bunch of related technologies. My browser tabs grow exponentially during a tutorial with all kinds of things I didn't know but now need to learn. That has been really helpful.
8. Really good tutorials are not that common. Much like really good teachers.
9. There are so many framework choices. So many. I could see analysis paralysis being an issue especially when there is rarely going to be an objectively best option. I have been listening to some podcasts on software architecture and one guest commented that decisions just have to get made. They may not be the best decisions, they may have to be revisited, they may have costs, but they need to get made and the show needs to get on the road. I am getting how that is an issue. In my last career, there was generally not the time to get into analysis paralysis about anything. Sub-optimal decision-making happened all the time, but things had to happen and happen now, so we made decisions, moved on, mitigated the costs of those decisions best we could, and tried to learn from our mistakes the next time.
